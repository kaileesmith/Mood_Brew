# Mood Brew
For our project, we have created a drink generator based on your mood. There are 3 mood options on the left side of our interface. When a user selects a mood category, then they will receive 2 alcohol options catered to that specific mood. They will then be able to do a coin flip to randomly select their type of alcohol. Once alcohol is selected a randomly generated drink option appears.

## User Story
